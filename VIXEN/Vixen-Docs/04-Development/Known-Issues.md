### KI-001 — 3 RenderGraph tests fail to build: missing `xcb/xcb.h` (WSL env)

**Discovered:** 2026-07-02 (during the config-struct codegen epic full-build gate; pre-existing, not caused by that work).
**Resolved:** 2026-07-02.

**Symptom:** a full `cmake --build build-wsl -- -k 0` failed to compile 3 test TUs:
- `libraries/RenderGraph/tests/test_array_type_validation.cpp`
- `libraries/RenderGraph/tests/test_field_extraction.cpp`
- `libraries/RenderGraph/tests/test_resource_gatherer.cpp`

Error (all three, identical): `.vulkan-sdk/1.4.350.1/x86_64/Include/vulkan/vulkan.h:52:10: fatal error: xcb/xcb.h: No such file or directory`.

**Root cause:** `vulkan.h` includes `<xcb/xcb.h>` when `VK_USE_PLATFORM_XCB_KHR` is defined; the WSL build environment has no XCB development headers installed (`libxcb1-dev` / `libxcb-*-dev`). These three tests pulled the full Vulkan platform header (transitively) rather than a headless subset — despite `test_type_system.cmake`'s own header stating "Compatible with VULKAN_TRIMMED_BUILD (headers only, no Vulkan runtime needed)".

**Fix applied (option 2 — root-cause):** removed the `VK_USE_PLATFORM_{XCB,WIN32,MACOS}_KHR` `target_compile_definitions` blocks from all 3 targets in `libraries/RenderGraph/tests/test_type_system.cmake`. These are header-only compile-time/type-trait tests that never link a real Vulkan surface; no sibling headless `.cmake` in the same directory (`test_core_systems.cmake`, `test_critical_nodes.cmake`, `test_graph_systems.cmake`, `test_voxel_systems.cmake`) defines a platform macro at all — this file was the outlier.

**Verified:** all 3 targets build clean and pass at runtime on WSL (no XCB headers installed) — `test_array_type_validation`, `test_field_extraction`, `test_resource_gatherer` all print their `✅ ALL TESTS PASSED` banners, exit 0.

**Severity:** Medium · **Status:** RESOLVED

### KI-002 — `test_shell_octree_gpu.ConcatRejectsMoreThanThree` fails (stale test vs removed cap)

**Discovered:** 2026-07-02 (config-struct codegen C1 gate; pre-existing, unrelated to that byte-identical struct alias).
**Resolved:** 2026-07-02.

**Symptom:** `test_shell_octree_gpu` was 8/9 — `ShellOctreeGpu.ConcatRejectsMoreThanThree` (`libraries/SVO/tests/test_shell_octree_gpu.cpp:179`) failed. The test built 4 shell octrees and asserted `EXPECT_THROW(Concatenate(four), std::length_error)`.

**Root cause:** the `kMaxOctrees = 3` cap was intentionally removed in the earlier recipe-authoring epic (the octree pool became memory-budgeted / count-unbounded — see the `recipe-authoring-pipeline-shipped` work; `ShellOctreeGpu.h`'s own `Concatenate()` docstring already read "Count is unbounded", and the sibling `ConcatenateSdf()` had a matching `OctreePool.ConcatenatesMoreThanThreeSdfOctrees` accept-test). `Concatenate` only throws `std::invalid_argument` on a null pointer, never on count, so the stale `EXPECT_THROW` failed. The test was never updated when the cap was removed.

**Fix applied (option 1 — genuinely unbounded):** renamed the test to `ConcatAcceptsMoreThanThree` and rewrote it to assert `Concatenate(four)` succeeds and produces a valid combined pool — `count == 4`, per-octree `nodeArrayBase`/`brickArrayBase` non-decreasing, and the concatenated `nodes`/`bricks` byte buffers equal to the sum of per-octree element counts times their stride (`sizeof(ChildDescriptor)` / `SerializedOctree::kBrickStrideBytes`), mirroring the existing `ConcatRecordsPerOctreeBaseOffsets` test's assertion style. Also corrected 3 stale "<=3 octrees" comment headers in `ShellOctreeGpu.h` (lines 55/57/663) that contradicted the function's own "Count is unbounded" docstring.

**Verified:** `test_shell_octree_gpu` is 9/9 passing at runtime (lavapipe-free, headless gtest).

**Severity:** Low · **Status:** RESOLVED
