## Areas Worth Meaningful Expansion

### ✅ ADDED: Two Paradigms for Voxel Rendering (Introduction)

Added to both markdown AND Word:

```markdown
### Two Paradigms for Voxel Rendering

**Mesh-Based Rendering (Indirect):** Voxel data → polygon meshes
(greedy meshing, marching cubes) → rasterization. Minecraft-style.
Requires mesh regeneration when voxels change.

**Direct Ray-Based Rendering:** Rays traced directly through volumetric
data structures. No intermediate mesh. Preserves native voxel representation,
instant updates, natural transparency/volumetric effects.

This study focuses exclusively on direct ray-based rendering...
```

This clarifies the research scope and distinguishes from Minecraft-style approaches.

### Priority 1: Introduction - Additional Expansion

**Still missing:
  - Game engines seeking voxel rendering solutions
  - Medical visualization (CT/MRI volumetric data)
  - CAD/architectural visualization
  - Virtual production / real-time VFX

- **Gap statement:** What's missing in existing literature?
  - No comprehensive comparison of all 3 Vulkan pipeline types
  - Most studies focus on rasterization vs ray-casting, not hardware RT
  - Limited cross-GPU analysis (most papers use single GPU)

- **Scope clarification:** What this study does NOT cover
  - Secondary rays / global illumination
  - Dynamic scene updates
  - CPU overhead / BVH construction time

**Suggested expansion:**

```markdown
Real-time voxel rendering enables applications from medical imaging
(CT/MRI visualization) to game engines (destructible environments,
procedural worlds) and architectural CAD. While traditional rasterization
dominates polygon-based rendering, volumetric data benefits from ray-based
approaches that efficiently skip empty space.

Previous comparative studies [1, 7] evaluated rasterization versus
ray-casting, but the emergence of hardware-accelerated ray tracing
(NVIDIA RTX, AMD RDNA2) introduces a third option unexplored in
comprehensive benchmarks. Existing hardware RT evaluations [7] focus
on secondary ray performance for global illumination, leaving primary
ray performance—critical for real-time visualization—understudied.

This paper addresses this gap by systematically comparing three Vulkan
pipeline architectures across 5 GPU platforms and 981 test configurations,
providing actionable guidance for engine developers selecting rendering
approaches for voxel-based applications.
```

### Priority 2: Discussion Section (Currently tables-heavy → Add interpretation)

**What's missing:**
- **Why H2 was contradicted:** Theoretical explanation
  - Expected: Compute has predictable per-pixel cost
  - Reality: Hardware RT's BVH traversal naturally adapts to scene density
  - RT cores skip empty space at hardware level, while software must iterate

- **Practical implications for engine developers:**
  - When to choose each pipeline
  - Memory vs performance trade-offs
  - Migration path from compute to hardware RT

- **What the density-independence means:**
  - Hardware RT is "scene-agnostic" - performance predictable
  - Compute varies with scene complexity - harder to budget
  - Fragment varies with screen-space coherence

**Suggested expansion (~400 words):**

```markdown
### 5.X Interpreting the Results

**Why Hardware RT Achieves Density Independence**

The contradication of H2—that compute would show lowest cross-scene
variation—reveals a fundamental architectural difference. Software ray
marching (compute/fragment) iterates through octree levels sequentially,
with iteration count proportional to ray depth and scene complexity.
Dense scenes like Tunnels require more iterations per ray.

Hardware RT cores, by contrast, perform BVH traversal in dedicated
silicon that naturally prunes empty subtrees. The hardware's parallel
box-intersection tests effectively "flatten" scene complexity—whether
5% or 90% fill rate, the BVH depth remains similar, and the RT cores
handle divergent rays without warp-level penalties.

This density-independence has practical implications:
1. **Performance budgeting:** Hardware RT FPS is predictable regardless
   of scene content, simplifying frame time budgets
2. **Content freedom:** Artists can create dense or sparse environments
   without performance cliffs
3. **LOD simplification:** Less need for aggressive level-of-detail
   culling in dense regions

**Migration Considerations**

For teams considering hardware RT adoption:
- **BLAS construction overhead:** Not measured in this study; may add
  CPU-side cost for dynamic scenes
- **Memory footprint:** Hardware RT requires ~2x VRAM versus compute
  (812 MB vs 277 MB average) for acceleration structures
- **Fallback path:** Intel iGPU lacks VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline;
  fragment pipeline provides universal fallback
```

### Priority 3: Theoretical Background / Related Work Expansion

**Currently:** 2 paragraphs, 9 citations

**What's thin:**
- No explanation of WHY these approaches differ architecturally
- No background on RT core architecture
- No discussion of prior voxel rendering history (Minecraft, MagicaVoxel, etc.)

**Suggested additions:**

1. **Brief RT Core Architecture** (1 paragraph)
   - RT cores perform ray-box intersection in hardware
   - BVH traversal unit separate from shader cores
   - Explains why dedicated hardware beats software

2. **Voxel Rendering History** (1 paragraph)
   - Early software voxel engines (Comanche, Delta Force)
   - Modern approaches (John Lin's voxel ray marching, Nvidia GVDB)
   - Why SVO became the dominant representation

3. **ESVO Algorithm Background** (expand existing)
   - Original Laine & Karras contribution
   - Your modifications (brick storage, pure voxel input)
   - Why this matters for performance

### Priority 4: Missing Sections Worth Considering

#### A. Critical Reflection (Required for Howest format)
**Currently:** In Word doc but not markdown

Should include:
- What you learned from the research process
- What you would do differently
- Challenges faced (V1 bugs, instrumentation issues)
- Skills developed

#### B. Reproducibility Statement
Many academic papers now include:
- Hardware/software versions (you have this in 3.4)
- Data availability statement
- Code availability (is VIXEN open source?)

#### C. Threats to Validity
Common in empirical studies:
- **Internal validity:** V1 bugs affected early data
- **External validity:** Limited to specific GPU vendors
- **Construct validity:** FPS as sole metric (no power, no latency percentiles beyond P99)
