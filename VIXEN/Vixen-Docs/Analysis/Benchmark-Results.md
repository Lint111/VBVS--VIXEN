# Benchmark Results Analysis

This document provides visual analysis of VIXEN rendering benchmark results.

> **Auto-generated charts**: Run `python tools/refresh_visualizations.py` to update all charts.

---

## Pipeline Performance Comparison

### FPS by Pipeline

![[charts/fps_by_pipeline.png]]

Average frames per second across all test configurations for each rendering pipeline.

### Frame Time by Pipeline

![[charts/frame_time_by_pipeline.png]]

Lower frame times indicate better performance. Target: <16.67ms for 60fps.

---

## Resolution Analysis

### FPS by Resolution

![[charts/fps_by_resolution.png]]

Performance scaling across different SVO resolutions (voxels per axis).

### Resolution × Scene Heatmap

![[charts/resolution_heatmap.png]]

Color-coded FPS values showing which resolution/scene combinations perform best (green) or worst (red).

---

## Scene Analysis

### FPS by Scene Type

![[charts/fps_by_scene.png]]

Scene complexity impacts performance differently across pipelines.

---

## Statistical Analysis

### Frame Time Distribution

![[charts/frame_time_distribution.png]]

Box plot showing frame time variance. Tighter distributions indicate more consistent performance.

### Memory Bandwidth

![[charts/bandwidth_comparison.png]]

Memory bandwidth utilization by pipeline. Higher is generally better for data-intensive operations.

## Key Findings

### Performance Summary

| Pipeline | Relative Performance | Best Use Case |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Hardware RT | Baseline | General rendering |
| SW Raymarch | Varies | Low-VRAM scenarios |
| Compressed | TBD | Memory-constrained |

### Observations

1. **Resolution scaling**: [Add observations after running benchmarks]
2. **Scene impact**: [Add observations after running benchmarks]
3. **Pipeline tradeoffs**: [Add observations after running benchmarks]
