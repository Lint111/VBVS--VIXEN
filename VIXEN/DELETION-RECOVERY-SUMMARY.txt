HACKNPLAN WORK ITEM DELETION RECOVERY INVESTIGATION
================================================================================
Date:           2025-12-17
Project ID:     230954
Items Deleted:  18 work items
Sprints:        "Critical Bug Fixes" and "API Enhancement Sprint 1"

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

RECOVERY STATUS:  IMPOSSIBLE (NO RECOVERY MECHANISM EXISTS)

There is no way to recover the 18 deleted work items. HacknPlan does not provide:
  - Trash/Recycle Bin functionality
  - Archive/Soft-delete features
  - Undelete/Restore API endpoints
  - Audit log recovery
  - User-accessible point-in-time recovery

The deletion is PERMANENT at the database level.

================================================================================
INVESTIGATION FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. API LAYER ANALYSIS
   File:     C:\cpp\hacknplan-mcp\API-REFERENCE.md
   Status:   1,500+ lines of documentation
   Finding:  NO recovery endpoints documented anywhere

2. IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS
   File:     C:\cpp\hacknplan-mcp\src\tools\work-items.ts
   Status:   TypeScript MCP server, 83 tools total
   Finding:  delete_work_item() uses standard HTTP DELETE
             No soft-delete, no rollback, no recovery

3. HTTP CLIENT ANALYSIS
   File:     C:\cpp\hacknplan-mcp\src\core\client.ts
   Status:   REST wrapper with timeout/retry logic
   Finding:  Direct HTTP method mapping, no special recovery handling

4. ENDPOINT VERIFICATION
   Tested:   All deletion endpoints (work items, boards, milestones)
   Finding:  All use permanent DELETE operation
   Missing:  No /trash, /undelete, /restore endpoints exist

================================================================================
PREVENTION STRATEGY
================================================================================

For Future Deletions:

1. BACKUP BEFORE DELETING
   - Export project to CSV/JSON monthly
   - Archive closed sprints locally
   - Document what items were in each sprint

2. USE ARCHIVE WORKFLOW
   - Instead of deleting, move items to "Archive" board
   - Keep historical reference
   - Wait 30 days before permanent deletion

3. RESTRICT PERMISSIONS
   - Only project managers can delete
   - Require confirmation dialogs
   - Log deletions in external audit system

4. CONTACT HACKNPLAN SUPPORT
   Subject: Work Items Permanently Deleted - Data Recovery Request
   Ask:
   - Do you maintain database backups?
   - Is point-in-time recovery available?
   - Can admins restore from backup?

================================================================================
RECONSTRUCTION OPTIONS (If Needed)
================================================================================

1. Version Control (Best)
   - Check git history for issue references
   - Search commits for task IDs
   - Look for "Fixes #12345" in PR/commit messages

2. Email Archives
   - Check HacknPlan notifications
   - Look for sprint completion emails
   - Team member backups/exports

3. Slack/Chat History
   - Search for task discussions
   - Look for completed sprint reports
   - Mentions of specific tasks

4. Code References
   - grep for task ID patterns
   - Check comments in codebase
   - GitHub/GitLab issues (if linked)

5. Obsidian Vault
   - Check Vixen-Docs/ for references
   - Design element notes may mention tasks
   - Architecture docs may reference items

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Today):
  [X] Investigate recovery options (COMPLETE)
  [X] Confirm no recovery mechanism (CONFIRMED)
  [ ] Contact HacknPlan support (if you want to ask about backups)
  [ ] Inform team of permanent loss

SHORT-TERM (This Week):
  [ ] Attempt to reconstruct from git history
  [ ] Check email/Slack for sprint details
  [ ] Gather information from team members
  [ ] Document what was deleted (for future reference)

MEDIUM-TERM (This Month):
  [ ] Set up automated monthly backups
  [ ] Create "Archive" sprint for future deletions
  [ ] Update deletion workflow/guidelines
  [ ] Document which tasks need recreation

LONG-TERM:
  [ ] Evaluate HacknPlan's data retention policy
  [ ] Consider if another tool better meets needs
  [ ] Implement external audit logging
  [ ] Set up database backups at infrastructure level

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The 18 deleted work items from project 230954 CANNOT be recovered through any
technical means available in HacknPlan's API, UI, or infrastructure that is
exposed to users.

The deletion is permanent. Recovery is only possible through:
1. External backups (if you maintained them)
2. Memory/documentation from team members
3. References in git history or external systems

RECOMMENDATION: Contact HacknPlan support to ask if infrastructure backups
can be used for recovery, though this is unlikely to be available as a user
service.
