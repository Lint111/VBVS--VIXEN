[VK_DEBUG_REPORT] ERROR: [Validation] Code 0 : vkBeginCommandBuffer(): on active VkCommandBuffer 0x207ef893250 before it has completed. You must check command buffer fence before this call.
The Vulkan spec states: commandBuffer must not be in the recording or pending state (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.321.1/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#VUID-vkBeginCommandBuffer-commandBuffer-00049)
[VK_DEBUG_REPORT] ERROR: [Validation] Code 0 : vkQueueSubmit(): pSubmits[0].pCommandBuffers[0] VkCommandBuffer 0x207ef893250 is already in use and is not marked for simultaneous use.
The Vulkan spec states: If any element of the pCommandBuffers member of any element of pSubmits was not recorded with the VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT, it must not be in the pending state (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.321.1/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#VUID-vkQueueSubmit-pCommandBuffers-00071)
[VK_DEBUG_REPORT] ERROR: [Validation] Code 0 : vkQueueSubmit(): pSubmits[0].pWaitSemaphores[0] queue (VkQueue 0x207e82b95f0) is waiting on semaphore (VkSemaphore 0x640000000064) that has no way to be signaled.
The Vulkan spec states: All elements of the pWaitSemaphores member of all elements of pSubmits created with a VkSemaphoreType of VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY must reference a semaphore signal operation that has been submitted for execution and any semaphore signal operations on which it depends must have also been submitted for execution (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.321.1/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#VUID-vkQueueSubmit-pWaitSemaphores-03238)
[VK_DEBUG_REPORT] ERROR: [Validation] Code 0 : vkQueueSubmit(): pSubmits[0].pSignalSemaphores[0] (VkSemaphore 0x870000000087) is being signaled by VkQueue 0x207e82b95f0, but it may still be in use by VkSwapchainKHR 0x5c000000005c.
Here are the most recently acquired image indices: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, [1].
(brackets mark the last use of VkSemaphore 0x870000000087 in a presentation operation)
Swapchain image 1 was presented but was neither re-acquired nor waited on using a VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1 fence, so VkSemaphore 0x870000000087 may still be in use.
Vulkan insight: One solution is to assign each image its own semaphore. This also handles the case where vkAcquireNextImageKHR returns the same index twice in a row. Here are some common methods to ensure that a semaphore passed to vkQueuePresentKHR is not in use and can be safely reused:
	a) Use a separate semaphore per swapchain image. Index these semaphores using the index of the acquired image.
	b) Consider the VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1 extension. It allows using a VkFence with the presentation operation.
The Vulkan spec states: Each binary semaphore element of the pSignalSemaphores member of any element of pSubmits must be unsignaled when the semaphore signal operation it defines is executed on the device (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.321.1/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#VUID-vkQueueSubmit-pSignalSemaphores-00067)
