# RenderGraph Tests

This directory holds unit tests for the RenderGraph library.

Conventions:
- Test sources use GoogleTest (GTest).
- Each test binary is in its own directory and exposes a `CMakeLists.txt` that can be added to the top-level tests CMake target.

Placeholder test added: `test_rendergraph_basic.cpp`.
